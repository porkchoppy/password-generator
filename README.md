# Password-Generator

## Description
This repository links to a password generator, in which a password will be created using certain criteria selected by the user. The user is prompted to choose their password length and whether the password should contain a combination of lowercase and/or uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Once they have responded to all the prompts and click "Generate" the password is displayed on the screen. I learned how to manipulate code through JavaScript in order to have a dynamic webpage. 

## Usage

Here is the series of prompts for the user to select their criteria.
